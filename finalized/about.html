        <p>  Hi! I am an undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying cognitive science and minoring in data science and disability studies. 
          I am passionate about the intersection of human centered design, accessibility, and language. 
          I am a coda, so my enthusiasm for these domains stems from my love for the deaf community and sign language. 
          My research currently focuses on spatial cognition in deaf-blind signers and cross-linguistic patterns between different sign languages. 
          I am interested in exploring the impact of new technologies and the innovation of AI on disabled people.
           My long term goals are developing NLP technology for ASL that preserves the affection and complexity of the language, potentially getting a PhD in computational linguistics, and continuing to illustrate and design whenever possible!
          </p>
        <p> I am passionate about trying new foods, getting my daily sweet treat, skincare and fragrances, wellness, reading and buying books, listening to podcasts on long walks, going to art museums, 
          traveling, and graphic design. I love taking on projects that involve problem solving through coding and creativity through meticulous illustration. 
        </p>
