						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article gave many valuable resources for learning more about typology and accessing inspiration
								for typology. I thought that this article was very interesting ebacuse it connected to human centered design. It is important to design a website that is intentionally
							designed for those who will view it. I really liked the example they used of a font that is easily understood by children. This connects to the broader idea that design connects 
						with education and accesibility, two topics I am passionate about.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed looking at the website examples they chose. Using simpler fonts for websites with more images isn't something
								I would necessarily think about. Also using different fornts for organization purposes is functional but ads a unique design element. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "before choosing a font, research its intended purpose" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
