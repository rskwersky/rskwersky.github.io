        <p> Hi! My name is Rachel Skwersky. I am a third year at UC Berkeley. I love 
            playing the sims, going on hot girl walks, and trying out new recipes.
            A fun fact about me is that I hate bananas and will never eat them by itself,
            but I love trying out banana recipes. I prefer podcasts to listening to music (unhinged, I'm sorry)
            and my current favorites are Binchtopia, Seamoss Girlies, and the Daily. I love buying books
            and sometimes reading them. I crochet occasionally and draw sometimes, but I'm not fantastic at either.
            I'm from Massachusetts and I have a goldendoodle at home named Ruby. My fourth roommate is a kitten named
            Soup. I love to sit in cafes and get a fun beverage and my favorite weekend activity is getting
            a bagel and enjoying it in the sunshine at Willard Park.

                <li> Something I learned from this article is to be a curious and active engager with apps. If you question each element
                    of a website or app, you'll be able to better develop an eye for things to include in your own projects. I also liked the portion on
                    intent and content as its really important to think of who will be using your product and what they will think while interacting with it </li>
                <li> I really enjoyed the breakdowns of each app. It was cool to see each detail appear one at a time and it really allowed me to slow down
                    and study each element of the layout closely to see how it all fit together. </li>
                <li> "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product." </li>
                <li> I enjoyed this article, so I would rate it an 8/10. I don't feel like I came across any topics that I hadn't seen before, but I found the app breakdowns interesting.</li>
