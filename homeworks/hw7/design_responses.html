						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article was interesting, but I did not have access to the full thing because it's a 
								members only piece. I learned what Gestalt principle is, "the organized whole of an image
								is greater than the sum of its parts". This is interesting because it relies on cognitive science
							and the way the brain perceives things. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the picture of the clouds. I couldn't really see much else of the article, but it
								was cool to think of how we mentally make images out of things that are not literally there. For example,
							seeing a smiley face in food. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Having an understanding how your brain works will help you become a wiser designer; master manipulator of Visual Communication. 
								It can help you determine which visual elements are most effective in any given situation, so you can use them to influence perception, direct attention and cause behavioural change." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
