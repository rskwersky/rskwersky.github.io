							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was all of the animations in each portion. As i progress through the class, I appreciate more and more 
								the complexity and design of the websites that I see. It was interesting to think about how all of these things can be achieved with CSS and a few lines of code. It is very inspiring to see.
