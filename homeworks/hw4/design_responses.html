						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned that there are regulations to ensure accessibility for people
								with visual impairments. This made me curious as to how this is rgeulated and implemented on a large scale. Thus, to ensure accesibility, it falls
							on the responsibility of the designer to make a product that is accesible and enjoable to all. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found the color contrast ratio portion interesting. I love using color in my designs, but people have often
								pointed out that the contrast is too low for them even though it is sufficent for me. Now that there is a standard and measurable way to test
								the contrast, I can create designs that are more thoughful and don't just rely on my own abilities.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
