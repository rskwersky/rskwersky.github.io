                            <p> Each one of the animations, especially the travel map for Radio Design, is so thought through.
                                As I learn more and more about web design, I realize that it is not necessarily a simple and quick process.
                            To create something beautiful and seamless, each interation with a design must be thought throu,
                        from the hover, to the click, to visual aspects that give more information on a page. It inspires me to 
                    think more about the designs I will create going forward. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really liked some of the transition animations. I often see transition animations as I scroll
                                on a website, and I've always wondered how designers do this and make it look so fluid.
                            The block animations for the photography/magazine website were especially cool to watch.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite animation was the "add to cart" animation. The wobble of the sliding menu and the changing colors were integrated so seamlessly. 
                                The menu sliding animation could easily change colors because it had a rainbow animation, and the wobble made it seem smoother, rather than choppy.
                                Also, the shoes getting smaller as the size gets smaller added a nice visual transition when scrolling through the shoe sizes.
                            </p>
